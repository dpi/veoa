Views Contextual Entity Operation Access Control (VEOA)

Provides a Views access control plugin checking if the user can perform an
operation on an entity in context.

Access is granted if the current user has permission to execute an operation 
(view, update, delete, custom, etc) on an entity. It determines which entity to 
check via contextual arguments.
